## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Important! Trust only commits with proof and are verified; if theyâ€™re not, they may be hacked.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on game engine
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python rust
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on c++/c stuff or rust or python
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how i feel
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: just dm me on discord
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: am a gamedev and i dont have any games yet
